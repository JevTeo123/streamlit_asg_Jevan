The purpose of this project is to query data from the snowflake database and create a customer segmentation model using the data to classify whether the customers are high or low spenders using a machine learning model. A streamlit app is then created, revolving around the machine learning model that allows users to enter specific customer behaviors to see if the customer is a high or low spender.
