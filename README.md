# Project Title
The purpose of this project is to query data from the snowflake database and create a customer segmentation model using the data to classify whether the customers are high or low spenders using a machine learning model. A streamlit app is then created, revolving around the machine learning model that allows users to enter specific customer behaviors to see if the customer is a high or low spender.

# Usage

The model has already been pickled and readily available in the github. To see how customer behaviour affects how they are a high or low spender, this [streamlit](https://appasgjevan-m6wynvdt6f62d3xd2x28em.streamlit.app/) app can be used to accomplish this task.

The first page of the streamlit app shows the purpose of the streamlit app as well as a sidebar to toggle between the different pages.

The second page contains the input boxes where users can enter in different values to mimic different customer behaviours and see how they affect whether a customer would be a high or low spender. This page also gives users a retrospective view as to the possible areas where these types of customers can be found to maximize on profits.

The third page contains some distinct insights that can be derived from the data about how the different inputs might cause a customer to be a high or low spender.
