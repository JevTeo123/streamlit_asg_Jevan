# Project Title
The purpose of this project is to query data from the snowflake database and create a customer segmentation model using the data to classify whether the customers are high or low spenders using a machine learning model. A streamlit app is then created, revolving around the machine learning model that allows users to enter specific customer behaviors to see if the customer is a high or low spender.

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
The model has already been pickled and readily available in the github. To see how customer behaviour affects how they are a high or low spender, this [streamlit] (https://appasgjevan-m6wynvdt6f62d3xd2x28em.streamlit.app/) app can be used to accomplish this task.

The first page of the streamlit app shows the purpose of the streamlit app as well as a sidebar to toggle between the different pages.
